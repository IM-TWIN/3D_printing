# 3D printing


## 3D printer

Anycubic Kossel Linear Plus.

## Software

Ultimaker [Cura 4.11](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura), Linux 64 bit, AppImage.

Please note the added line to start g-code:

which makes the etruder stop for a little while at 1.5 cm from bed, before starting the printing.
